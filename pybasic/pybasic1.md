# some key points in python

## print 
Print followed by multiple outputs, separated by commas  
`a=1`  
`print(a,type(a))`
    
## sequence
There are two kinds of sequences: tuple and list.
    
```
s1=(2,1.3,'love')
s2=[True,5,'smile']
print(s1,type(s1))
print(s2,type(s2))
```
## Index of elements
Subscripts for sequence elements start at 0  
`print(s1[0])`  
Basic Style [Lower Limit: Upper Limit: Step Size]  
`print(s1[2:0:-1])`  
(The Upper limit itself is not included.)

## Strings are tuples

## Operation
`print 'a' in ['a','b']`

## Indent
```
a=2  
b=1  
if a>b:
   print a+b
else:
   print a-b  
```
## Loop
range()  
for element in sequence  
while conditon:  
continue  
break
